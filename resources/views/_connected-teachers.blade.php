            Darby’s Dancers friend and partner, Tricia Gomez, has created <strong>The Teaching Artist Exchange</strong>, a “global marketplace where you can buy and sell to others in your field, and support other Teaching Artists who have worked to create the best learning environment for their students.” This will be a very useful tool for all of us as we search for the best materials and programs available for all our students. There are lots of items in the exchange that are useful for teaching our students, for example, the visual aides kit and Hip Hop in a Box and more!  The Teaching Artist Exchange is an ever changing tool, as new artists contribute to it. We bet YOU have lessons and ideas YOU have used in working with Darby’s Dancers students that you can contribute, as well.
